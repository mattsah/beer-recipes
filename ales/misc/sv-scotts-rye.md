# Silicon Valley Scott's Rye

Scott's Rye is a bastard using some features from Scottish Ales along with a strong Rye base.

## Ingredients

- 2.5# Rye Malt
- 2.5# Pilsen Malt
- 0.5# Honey
- 0.5# Crystal

- .5 oz Liberty (pellets)
- .5 oz Willamette (pellets)
- 1 oz US Brewers Gold (pellets)
- 1 vile WLP028
- 3.5 Gallons of Water
- 1/5 Cups of Corn Sugar (+2 cups water)

## Equipment

- The Usual (2 Gallons)
- Turkey Roasting Pan (deep sides) for 6lbs grain + 1.5 Gallons of Water
- Fine strainer

## Preamble

This was originally going to be 1 Gallon as my first all grain for experimentation but I opted to go with two gallons.  I actually tried a different type of yeast (British Ale Yeast) for the other gallon, but the original recipe used WLP028 Edinburgh Scottish Ale Yeast.

I really like a lot of rye beers and I wanted to try something with a high amount of rye and a "quiet" base (hence the Pilsen).  The honey and crystal were main to add some additional character.

## Process

Bring a 1.5 gallons of water to 175 degrees.  Mill your malt relatively finely, but not to powder.  Pour water into large turkey roasting pan and add your malt.  Stir well and place in 175 degree preheated oven.  Depending on the size and quality of your oven you may need to increase or decrease temperature, but your goal is to keep the mash at 150.

Keep the mash in the oven for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally and checking temperature.  While in oven, bring another .5 gallons of water to 150 degrees and keep steady.

Once completed, remove the mash from the oven and spoon the grain into smaller portions into the strainer.  Pour appropriate portions of your heated .5 gallons over the mash to wash off additional sugars and discard portions.  Repeat until you have washed all the grain and are left with mostly liquid.  Pour the liquid through the strainer into your boiling pot and into any remaining hot water you have.

Begin bringing to a boil, slowly adding the final 1.5 gallons.  Once at a rolling boil, add .5 oz liberty hops.  Maintain boil for 30 minutes and add .5 oz willamette and .5 oz US Brewer's Gold.

At 50 minutes remove from heat and add another .5 oz US Brewer's Gold.  Chill wort as rapidly as possible to 70 degrees or slighltly cooler.

### Primary

Pitch the full vial of WLP028 Edinburgh Scottish Ale Yeast into a 2+ Gallon container, or if you've split the batch to two single gallon containers, use half and half.  Using a yeast nutrient should help this yeast get moving within  the first 24 hours.  The suggested temperature range is between 65 and 70 degrees, but this yeast is particularly noted as not fermenting well at less than 62.

### Secondary (Optional)

I opted to experiment with bentonite as a fining solution during a secondary phase.  You can look into fining solutions of your choice, but I do not particularly recommend it one way or another.

### Bottling

Heat 1/2 cups of water enough to dissolve 1/5 cup of corn sugar.  Let the solution cool and slowly on top of the beer in a bottling bucket.  Stir gently to ensure equal distribution.

Syphon beer into bottles and firmly cap.

This beer is relatively hoppy up front.  Conditioning will give it some time to mellow and some of the more subtle flavors of the grain should be revealed.  This is one you will definitely want to condition as long as you can stand without drinking it.  Given that it's a smaller batch, you might find it difficult to keep it for too long.
