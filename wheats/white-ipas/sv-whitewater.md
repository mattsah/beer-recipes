# Silicon Valley Whitewater IPA

Whitewater IPA is my first attempt at a white with stronger hop flavor, following the likes of Deschutes Chainbreaker.

## Ingredients

- 3# Light Pilsner DME
- 3# Light Wheat DME
- 2# Rye Malt
- 1 oz Cascade (pellets)
- 1 oz Amarillo (pellets)
- 2 oz Citra (pellets)
- 1 vile WLP500 (Liquid Trappist Yeast)
- 5.5 Gallons of Water
- 3/4 Cups of Corn Sugar (+2 cups water)

## Equipment

- The Usual (5 Gallons)
- Large deep baking pan for 2lbs grain + half gallon water
- Fine strainer

## Preamble

Follow instructions for yeast (usually you will want store it in the fridge and remove it 3 - 6 hours before brewing).  You can create a starter if you like, but I didn't for this batch.

Chill 2 gallons of the water in the fridge, the remaining 3.5 will be used for boil/mashing.

## Process

Bring a half-gallon of water to 175 degrees.  Pour rye malt into a large deep baking pan and preheat oven to 150 degrees or as low as it will go if it won't go to 150.  Pour water over grains in baking pan, stir thoroughly and place in the oven for 45 minutes.  Stir ocassionally for the first 30 minutes.  At 30 minutes, bring another half gallon of water to 150 degrees.

Bring 2.5 gallons water to a boil in the large boiling pot; just before boil slowly stir in DME constantly mixing.  Spoon rye malt into strainer and pour an appropriate portion of your half gallon @ 150 over the malt.  If your strainer is really fine you may wish to reduce the amount of water in the boil and add more to the 150 stock to thoroughly rinse the grains.

Strain all remaining malt grain wort which was not spooned into the boil.

Add 1oz cascade hops and continue boil for 30 minutes.  At 30 minutes add 1oz Amarillo and .5oz Citra for another 15 minutes.  At 45 minutes add in an additional .5oz Citra.  Remove from heat at 60 minutes and chill wort as quickly as possible to ~80 degrees.

Fill your fermenter with the 2 gallons of chill water and pour cooled wort into the fermenter, allowing for splashing to oxygenate the wort.  The cool water should chill your wort to a good starting temperature for the yeast, but you may want to check it real quick and ensure it's in a range of ~68 - 72 degrees.  Pitch your yeast and give it a light stir.  Add all remaining Citra hops to primary fermenter and seal it up.

OG: 1.075

### Primary

The WLP500 has a reputation for a "late start."  Do not be surprised if you don't see a lot of activity within the first 48 hours.  Using a starter or two viles may improve the initial fermentation.  The recommended fermentation time is 14 days, however you can take a gravity reading after the first week.

Keep temperature steady between 70 - 74 and let rise slowly to 78 for the last week.

FG: 1.012

### Secondary (Optional)

After the target FG is reached, I will generally transfer to a bottling bucket and let it sit for another couple days.  This is not a complete secondary conditioning, but is enough to provide a little bit of clarity for natural carbonation / bottling.

### Bottling

Heat 2 cups of water enough to dissolve 3/4 cups of corn sugar.  Let cool but keep stirring to make sure no sugar settles out.  Very slowly (almost a drip pour) add sugar to secondary with a gentle swirl, try not to disturb any additional settlement at the bottom.  I find using long table spoon or short serving spoon works well for this.

Syphon beer into bottles and firmly cap.

Keep in bottles at least 2 weeks, then chill and enjoy.
