# Homebrew Beer Recipes

This repository contains beer recipes organized roughly by type.  All recipes are welcome from Mr. Beer to All Grains.

## Notes

All brewers should read recipes and procedures in full taking note and highlighting the required equipment.  We are not perfect we might mention something in the procedure which is not reflected in the equipment list.  If you have any questions, open an issue and we'll try to help.

### Rules

All recipes added should have a complete list of ingredients including quanities of all ingredients, *even water*, and don't forget priming sugars.

All recipes should contain a list of equipment (we're more forgiving on this) which might not be part of a normal basic DME or LME process.  You can specify "The Usual (5 Gallons)" for standard 5 gallon equipment, or change the parenthetical quantity for larger recipes, e.g. "The Usual (13 Gallons)."

"The Usual" equipment consists of any and all of the following which is part of standard brewing practices for DME and LME.  All of this will likely be included in a starter kit from your local homebrew store.  *This does not include a mash tun, so please specify a mash tun if your recipe is all grain.*

- **Large Boiling Pot**:  Following these recipes assume your boiling pot can hold the amount of wort required for boil.  This may be higher than the amount of the final yield.  That is, a 5 gallon batch might require a pot that can hold roughly 6 gallons of liquid (5.5 gallons water, as well as malt extract).
- **Sanitizer**: Recipes do not need to specify sanitization procedures.  All brewers should research best sanitization practices before brewing.
- **Airlock and/or Blow Off Tube**:  Brewers should be familiar with the fact that during primary fermentation the wort will produce CO2 gas and may also produce a thick head of foam (Krausen), this can overflow depending on the amount of head space in your fermenter.
- **Fermenter**:  Similar to boil pot, you should check the size specification to determine if you should be cutting the recipe or looking for larger equipment.
- **Other**: We will not tell you how to syphon, bottle, or transfer beer.  You will also need to occasionally check temperatures or gravity readings, so a thermometer and hydrometer are expected.  There's lots of information online about this.  You will likely need a bunch of bottles, plastic tube and/or bottling wand, and bottle caps.

### Definitions

- **OG**: Original Gravity (determined with a hydrometer)
- **FG**: Final Gravity (determined with a hydrometer)

### Structure

The structure of recipes should roughly include all of the following sections:

- Introduction (with name of beer as heading and a quick intro to what it is and what the goal is).
- Ingredients (bullet point list of ingredients, should include all ingredients)
- Equipment (bullet point list of equipment not considered part of "The Usual" above)
- Procedure (Mash and boil description ending with OG)
  - Primary (Should not the FG at the end)
  - Secondary (optional if your recipe suggests one)
  - Bottling (specify a suggested priming / bottling method)

 Add directories as needed for various styles of beer.  Use a - instead of a space.  All recipes should be in markdown format and should begin with a short 2 - 3 character namespace for the location the recipe was attempted, for example `sv-name.md` where `sv` is used for "Silicon Vallye" and `name` is the name of the beer.
